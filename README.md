What Does This Module Do Sargfam database and profile Hidden Markov Models based alignment algorithm for ARGs-like sequences annotation were a function module in ARGs-OAP v2.0, supporting supplementary sequence retrieval strategy to current similarity search method (i.e. UBLAST and BLAST), especially applied on detecting remote homolog (novel genes).
